In its most basic form, 

get a bujo notebook or print a dotted sheet of paper
why dotted? blank pages cost time iin alligning frames later
lined pages have that problem with columns
squared pages can give trouble when lines intersect with your drawings
dotted pages are super easy to allign your drawings and the dots take no time to be deleted in an image editor.

also use one dot for the "center of mass" of your drawing so that he doesnt seem to wobble when it is being animated. Youll see.

In this case we used gimp, its free, multiplatform and simple to learn.

Set grid to visible in 
View > show grid

then in edit
Edit > Configure grid

Or something like that, youll work it out.

Use the grid so that at least four squares make up a frame, that way you have a crosshair thing going through your character, thisll make it so much simpler to see allignment problems.

Further things on animation as I learn them.
